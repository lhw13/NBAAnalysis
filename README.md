# NBAAnalysis
软工3大作业,展现NBA球员及球队信息和分析数据

This is a software done by college students as a course homework, aiming at analyzing and displaying NBA players' and teams' information. Database should be updated manually.
We have several quotations in the project. 
The score-predicting model is generated from <World Cup and Economics 2014> (http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/archive/world-cup-and-economics-2014.html). 
The idea of predicting win-rate comes from 2 papers: <A Model for Predicting the Outcomes of Basketball Games > (http://web.stanford.edu/~gbower/1994/Model_for_predicting_outcomes_basketball.pdf), 
and <Estimating the Effect of Home Court Advantage on Wins in the NBA> (http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1412&context=parkplace&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fcn.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DEstimating_the_Effect_of_Home_Court_Advantage_on_Wins_in_the_NBAl%26qs%3Dn%26form%3DQBRE%26pq%3Destimating_the_effect_of_home_court_advantage_on_wins_in_the_nbal%26sc%3D0-40%26sp%3D-1%26sk%3D%26cvid%3Dad29b3d50f364803868dc313f164d147#search=%22Estimating_the_Effect_of_Home_Court_Advantage_on_Wins_in_the_NBAl%22). 
Furthermore, we also import third-party jar files. We thank you all for sharing these tremendous articles and files with us. We feel sorry for use the ideas without informing the authors. If you are the authors, please be sure to let us know if you do not want your ideas to be used in our project. If we receive any dissatisfaction from the authors, we will amend our project as soon as possible. Moreover, we do a lot of reading in this project; it is hard for us to list every source where our ideas come from. Therefore, we thank all the inspiration you share. We never intend to intrude others copyright.
